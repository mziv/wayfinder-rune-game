Description

Okay team so a bit of backstory, there's this really cute social media app called Peach that my friends and I use - they have truly so few users but everyone who does use it LOVES it. 
It's designed to be much more personal + intimate; I'm only friends with like 12 people and we've all been posting our most personal thoughts and feelings on it for literal years. 
(I have no idea how they make money; it's free and there are no ads.)  

On that note, the app itself is pretty jank - with some regularity their servers will go down and we all end up locked out of the app. We all live in fear of the day that it goes down 
forever and we lose both our favorite site and like 3 years of memories. SO! I went to investigate and found out that although their online "request a backup" link does not work (it's 
supposed to email you with more info and can confirm they never do) the thing I realized is that the app is actually entirely built off of a web API. So long story short I reverse 
engineered it to make a backup script! It will download all of your posts to a semi readable format so that you can have them all saved forever.

I wanted to disseminate it to all my friends but I had to compile it to a jank .exe and being compatible across machines was a mess so only a few people ended up being able to use it. 
And I thought to myself - this should be a website! SO! After all that, basically I want to build a website that people can go to to securely log into Peach and get a nicely formatted 
file of all of your historical posts. Additionally, I think it would be fun to have some (opt in!) data analysis features that come with the backup - things like "most liked posts," 
"most frequently used keywords," etc. Ultimately the biggest parts will involve giving it a nice skin and properly implementing all of the relevant security options (csrf tokens in the 
forms, https, etc.) - I do actually want to publish this as a real site when I'm done. Plus yknow fun data visualizations.

Also I want the code to be written such that it's clear I never store any of people's data/login information on wherever I host this website unless they opt into the data visualizations! 
Not sure how much of this is outside the scope of this class but these are all for sure considerations. 

Milestones
----------
Milestone 1: Pretty interactive website skin
Milestone 2: Secure log into peach, run the script in its current form (collects all the batch data + downloads it to your computer)
Milestone 3: Optional data visualizations

External libraries and code
---------------------------
Uhh the peach API is relevant but otherwise I don't know enough to answer this question lol

Collaboration and resources
---------------------------
Peach :) Also will be getting input from my friends

Anything else?
