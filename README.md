# wayfinder-rune-game
 
This project was a series of puzzles I built for The Wayfinder Experience, an improv acting camp which shifted to an online format due to Coronavirus. It was meant to simulate "rune magic," with the campers reading through cryptic texts explaining the meaning behind the symbols and allowing them to progress through the puzzles. 

Controls: drag and drop symbols into the activation circle, rotate them using d/a keys or arrow keys. 

Notes after observation:
- Use cookies to remember people's progress through the game
- More options while you're completing a rune: go back to selection page and skip to a video (after unlocking)
